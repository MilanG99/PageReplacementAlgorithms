# Page Replacement Algorithms Analysis

Demonstrates the following page replacement algorithms in an Operating System and their efficiency:

- LRU
- FIFO
- Clock

Data is generated dynamically using a poission distribution, and working set size is varied throughout the duration of the program for visual analysis.

After the program is executed, the results are stored in columar format in "data.csv".

Plotting the data for each algorithm should display an optimal point for using each of the types of algorithms.
